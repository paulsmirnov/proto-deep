A function to create a deeply prototype-inherited object.

> I'm sorry, this project is **for demonstration purpose only.** It serves me as a playground
> helping to setup a development pipeline for a bigger project. That's why it contains so many
> tools not required for such a small function.
>
> If you really think the function might be helpful just let me know and I'll refactor the
> project to get rid of all the burden I've introduced here.
