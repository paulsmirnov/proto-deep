# Contributing to proto-deep

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the project!

I'm sorry, this project is **for demonstration purpose only.** It serves me as a playground
helping to setup a development pipeline for a bigger project. That's why it contains so many
tools not required for such a small function.

If you really think the function might be helpful just let me know and I'll refactor the
project to get rid of all the burden I've introduced here when I'm done with playing around.

Thank you again.
